// This example shows how to use the clock function to measure the performance of
// a kernel accurately.
//
// Blocks are executed in parallel and out of order. Since there's no synchronization
// mechanism between blocks, we measure the clock once for each block. The clock
// samples are written to device memory.

// System includes
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

// This kernel computes a standard parallel reduction and evaluates the
// time it takes to do that for each block. The timing results are stored
// in device memory.

// It's interesting to change the number of blocks and the number of threads to
// understand how to keep the hardware busy.
//
// Here are some numbers I get on my G80:
//    blocks - clocks
//    1 - 3096
//    8 - 3232
//    16 - 3364
//    32 - 4615
//    64 - 9981
//
// With less than 16 blocks some of the multiprocessors of the device are idle. With
// more than 16 you are using all the multiprocessors, but there's only one block per
// multiprocessor and that doesn't allow you to hide the latency of the memory. With
// more than 32 the speed scales linearly.
