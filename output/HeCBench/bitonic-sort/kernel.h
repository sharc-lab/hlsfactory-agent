// Bitonic Sort: this algorithm converts a randomized sequence of numbers into
// a bitonic sequence (two ordered sequences), and then merge these two ordered
// sequences into a ordered sequence. Bitonic sort algorithm is briefly
// described as followed:
//
// - First, it decomposes the randomized sequence of size 2**n into 2**(n-1)
// pairs where each pair consists of 2 consecutive elements. Note that each pair
// is a bitonic sequence.
// - Step 0: for each pair (sequence of size 2), the two elements are swapped so
// that the two consecutive pairs form  a bitonic sequence in increasing order,
// the next two pairs form the second bitonic sequence in decreasing order, the
// next two pairs form the third bitonic sequence in  increasing order, etc, ...
// . At the end of this step, we have 2**(n-1) bitonic sequences of size 2, and
// they follow an order increasing, decreasing, increasing, .., decreasing.
// Thus, they form 2**(n-2) bitonic sequences of size 4.
// - Step 1: for each new 2**(n-2) bitonic sequences of size 4, (each new
// sequence consists of 2 consecutive previous sequences), it swaps the elements
// so that at the end of step 1, we have 2**(n-2) bitonic sequences of size 4,
// and they follow an order: increasing, decreasing, increasing, ...,
// decreasing. Thus, they form 2**(n-3) bitonic sequences of size 8.
// - Same logic applies until we reach the last step.
// - Step n: at this last step, we have one bitonic sequence of size 2**n. The
// elements in the sequence are swapped until we have a sequence in increasing
// order.
//
// In this implementation, a randomized sequence of size 2**n is given (n is a
// positive number). At each stage, a part of step, the host redefines the
// ordered sequenes and sends data to the kernel. The kernel swaps the elements
// accordingly in parallel.
